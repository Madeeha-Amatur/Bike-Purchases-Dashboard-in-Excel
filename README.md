# Bike-Purchases-Dashboard-in-Excel
Utilized fake personal customer data to analyze which factors contribute to a customer's decision in purchasing a bike.
The data has been cleaned for data validity and completeness with column binning done on the Age column to gather further useful insight and saved as a new sheet.
Pivot tables have been utilized to create a dashboard.
Upon creating the dashboard, we can derive few key insights from the given dataset:
1) We notice that bike purchases are the highest in North American and Europe regions
2) Bike purchases are higher within the 'Male' customer group. We can also switch up the slicers for marital status, children and cars to notice that married customers with children (specially 3+ children) are more likely to purchase a bike
3) Bike purchases are higher among customers with a commute distance of 0-1 Miles (could also be due to our data not balanced with more groups of customers travelling less distance), while customers with commute distance of 10+ Miles usually don't purchase bikes
4) It is rather obvious that senior age group is unlikely to purchase bikes as compared to Young and Middle Age adults.
5) Customers with an income on the lower age of the income range are more likely to purchase a bike for commute purposes.
6) Customers owning more cars are unlikely to purchase a bike pertaining to them using their car for transport purpose while customers owning 0 - 2 cars are more likely to purchase a bike
